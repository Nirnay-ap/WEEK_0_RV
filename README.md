Summary of the Chip Modeling Life Cycle
This document outlines a multi-stage process for designing and verifying an integrated circuit (chip or SoC), emphasizing a methodology where the output of each stage is compared to a golden reference to ensure correctness.

The core philosophy is a "C-to-Silicon" flow that uses a high-level C language model as the primary specification, against which all subsequent implementations are rigorously verified.

Phase 1: Specification and High-Level Modeling (C Model)
Initial Specification: The system's functionality ("the apple") is first written in C code.

Golden Reference: This C code is compiled to generate an initial output (opp = oo), which becomes the golden reference (o1). The goal is to have oo = o1.

Model Testing: The C model is tested and refined to ensure its correctness ("coverness").

Phase 2: RTL Implementation and Verification
RTL Development: Once the C specification is finalised, the Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code is written.

Equivalence Checking: The same C test suite used for the model is now run on the RTL implementation, generating a new output (o2).

Verification Goal: The primary verification step is to ensure the RTL output matches the C model output: o1 = o2.

Phase 3: Architectural Partitioning and Synthesis
Design Partitioning: The RTL design is separated into two main sections:

Processor Code: Synthesizable logic that is converted into a gate-level netlist.

Peripherals & IP: Some peripherals are described as non-synthesizable "Signal RTL" or analog/mixed-signal blocks (e.g., ADC to PLL). These are instantiated multiple times to build the complete chip.

Phase 4: System-on-Chip (SoC) Integration and Verification
SoC Integration: The synthesized processor netlist and the peripheral blocks are integrated to form a complete SoC.

System-Level Check: The original C test graph is run on a model of the integrated SoC to generate an output (o3). The goal is to confirm that integration didn't break functionality: o1 = o2 = o3.

Phase 5: Physical Design and Tapeout
Physical Implementation: The gate-level netlist undergoes physical design steps (floorplanning, placement, routing) to create the final layout, resulting in a Graphical Data System (GDSII) file.

Final Checks: The physical design (Group2) goes through Design Rule Checking (DRC) and other verification steps before tapeout.

Final Verification: After physical implementation and voltage regulation, a final output (o4) is obtained. The ultimate goal of the entire lifecycle is to achieve functional equivalence at all stages: o1 = o2 = o3 = o4.

Key Takeaway:
The process is defined by a verification-centric approach, where a golden C reference model is used to validate the design at every major step—from behavioral model to RTL, to integrated SoC, and finally to physical implementation—ensuring the final silicon behaves exactly as originally specified
